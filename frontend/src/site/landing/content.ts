      'sign what you write, not so you can see what others wrote.',

  {
    question: 'Does it cost anything?',
    answer:
      'Reading and writing are free. Ecoa is a protocol rather than a ' +
      'company ' +
      'sitting between you and the review, so there is no placement to sell ' +
      'and no ranking to auction.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need to use my real name?',

      'No. An identity here is a key, not a legal name. You can stay ' +
      'pseudonymous and still be accountable, because everything you publish ' +
      'is provably by the same person.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can a business delete a bad review about it?',
    answer:
      'No. A business never held the review in the first place — the author ' +
      'signed it and independent nodes hold copies. It can reply, and it can ' +
      'dispute, and both of those are public too.',

    question: 'Can a business reply to me?',

      'Yes, and its reply is signed the same way yours is. If an account ' +
      'claims to speak for a business, you can see what backs that claim and ' +
      'who granted it.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What stops people writing fake reviews?',
    answer:
      'Nothing stops the writing. What changes is that a fresh identity with ' +
      'no history looks like exactly that, and a thousand of them created ' +
      'the ' +
      'same afternoon are visible as a pattern rather than as a score.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I delete something I wrote?',
    answer:
      'You can withdraw it, which marks it as withdrawn everywhere and stops ' +
      'it being shown. Copies already published cannot be reached into and ' +
      'erased — that is the cost of nobody being able to erase yours either.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can a review be edited?',
    answer:
      'Yes, and the edit is published as a new version rather than written ' +
      'over the old one. The earlier version stays part of the record, so an ' +
      'edit can never be silent.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens if I lose access to my identity?',
    answer:
      'This is the genuinely hard part. A lost key cannot be recovered by ' +
      'us, ' +
      'because we never had it. You can authorise a second device in advance ' +
      'and name a successor identity, and doing that early is worth the five ' +
      'minutes.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What does "verified" mean here?',
    answer:
      'On its own, nothing. Ecoa never issues a single badge. It shows which ' +
      'specific claim was checked, who checked it, and what that claim does ' +
      'not cover.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Who controls moderation?',

      'decide whether to honour it.',

    question: 'Is Ecoa a blockchain?',

      'No. There is no chain, no consensus round and no token. Reviews are ' +

      'makes one checkable — not agreement between miners.',
